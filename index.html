						<p>"it has opened my eyes to mental illness, what it is and eventually triggered me to find help for what I thought was simply part of life, which turned out to be depression and anxiety. my life has drastically improved after finding help and having therapy"</p>
						<p>@skoop</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>"These are real issues and I really learned to understand not to judge and to be very careful with other's feelings and expectations. Above all, it's nice to see people accepting vulnerability—I think we're all insecure, so it's important that we're all patient with each other. It's also nice to know that people struggle with anxiety issues—I can be like that at times as well... I really like to see things done once before I dive in myself."</p>

						<p>"I always want to go out and meet others in the development field, but I can't get myself to go to any of the meetups or conferences. I'd gone to one day conference but was too nervous to talk with any of the other attendees, so even though I really enjoyed the presentations, I left feeling like an idiot for not introducing myself to anyone."</p>
